- 👋 Hi, I’m @sypspace
- 👀 I’m interested in collaborate to develop something amazing (especially using PHP) and definitely make money from codes. I am quite proficient in programming languages such as PHP, Javascript, NodeJS, and MySQL (I also have experience with MSSQL).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to make software development projects simpler, faster, robust and sustainable. In spare time I also learn IoT using Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on paid projects, and do not rule out open-source projects I'm interested in.
- 📫 You can reach me via yogi@sypspace.com
